You find yourself a few fries short of a happy meal.
You realise you've forgotten to wear your helmet today.
Now you know why you're not allowed to sharpen the crayons.
You realize you're absolutely fucking retarded.
You reconsider the garbage that was about to come out of your mouth.
Simply thinking about trying to say that made you just a little bit dumber.
You re-evaluate your life choices.
How many times were you dropped as a child, exactly?
You'll need a breather after coming up with that thing.
You feel like a screw is loose... but you don't have any screws, do you?
You feel as if you're a few sandwiches short of a picnic.
You feel as though you're a few cards short of a full deck.
You feel like you're a few beers short of a six-pack.
You feel like you're a few metaphors short of a mental breakdown.
You feel like your IQ just dipped below room temperature.
You feel dumber than a box of Donk pockets, and boy are those dumb.
