You find yourself a few fries short of a happy meal.
You realise you've forgotten to wear your helmet today.
Now you know why you're not allowed to sharpen the crayons.
You realize you're absolutely heckin' retarded.
You reconsider the garbage that was about to come out of your mouth.
Simply thinking about trying to say that made you just a little bit dumber.
